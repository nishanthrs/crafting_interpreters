## Why
This is a learning exercise for me to understand how programming languages are built and how compilers work. There are lots of good components to this project like understanding how lexers work, constructing a custom parser, building abstract syntax trees, evaluating expressions, designing custom data structures, and many more.

## Compile Java classes
```
javac -d . lox/*.java
```

## Run REPL
```
java com.craftinginterpreters.lox.Lox
```
